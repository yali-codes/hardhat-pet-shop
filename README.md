# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
pnpm h:server
pnpm test:server
REPORT_GAS=true pnpm test:server
pnpm dev:server
pnpm dev:migrate
```
